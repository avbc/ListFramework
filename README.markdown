This README will be updated from time to time as neww features as added/removed.

Please note that this framework is released under the TBD, 
although this could change as our requirements/needs change, and/or DataOCD feels the 
license limits/abuses the usage of this Framework.  See the LICENSE document for more information.

We are currently working on the instructions for usage of this framework.  Currently, it is still 
under develop though parts are already in working order (such as recieving requests and storing 
the basic information into the $request object).

We obviously have our own fulltime jobs as this is a side project we're developing.  
With that in mind, we'll update this README as we get time.
